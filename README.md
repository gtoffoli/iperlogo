# iperlogo
Port of an extended version of the LOGO educational language.

Iperlogo is an extended implementation of LOGO for Windows, which was developed before 2000 and is still being used in some Italian schools.
It was the successor of several versions of LOGO for Ms-Dos, some of which were developed for Olivetti (SLOGO) and Mondadori (MLOGO).
All versions were the fruit of the collaboration between Giovanni Lariccia and me (Giovanni Toffoli), and a number of collaborators such as Mariarosaria Manco and Corrado Mayer.

Besides the classical "Turtle" window and the Commands window, Iperlogo allows to open a large number of additional Turtle windows, text editing windows ("Foglio") and "Browser" windows (HTML renderers).

Now I plan to make Iperlogo an open multi-platform application, and possibly to derive from it a version executable in the cloud from a web browser. However, the first step is simply the port of most C++ code to the VS-19 / VC-19 development environment.
Work is in progress, with very limited resources.
